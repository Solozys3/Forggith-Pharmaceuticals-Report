## Data Transformation
- For all the tables, the first rows were changed to become Headers.
- In the Sales Table, the data type for the "MonthYear" column was changed to Date. I also appended queries for the "2023-2025" sales table to the "2022" sales table and named it "Sales"

- In the Targets Table, I unpivoted the year columns, then I merged the month and the year column together. I also changed the data type to Date and renamed it as "Date"
